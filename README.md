# Running Grunt

For local development, run `grunt ws` to build the site and generate a preview with Browsersync at localhost:3000. As you edit files, the preview will automatically refresh.

Use `grunt dev` to generate a dev version of the site, and just `grunt` to generate a production version. Your hosted files will be located in the `docs` folder.
